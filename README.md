## How to play the game
The aim of the game is to make the player reaches the river without getting hit by bugs. The player can move by using arrow keys_ 'right', 'left', 'up', 'down'_. When the player win an alert message will show.

## How I made the game
I used the starter code _provided from Udacity_. The folder includes three JS file, 'engine.js' 'resources.js' and 'app.js'. I wrote my  code in the 'app.js' file. Using an **object-oriented** JS, I defined two class one for 'Enemy' the other for the 'Player'. Also I create 'checkCollisions' function by define the move event and check collision in 'row and 'column.
